# First week

## What I got done
After some pondering and lots of googling, I narrowed my topic down to a 2D ASCII dungeon generator. First I figured I'd do a comparison of few different types of generation algorithms, but after discovering the blog post by Bob Nystrom, I fell in love with the hypnotic animations and decided to replicate his dungeon generator instead. As the generator has several stages and uses a variety of algorithms (and data structures), I consider it'll be quite sufficient a project on its own.

After this I started learning the method and figuring out the basics, and essentially writing my understanding of the method as the specifications document for this project.

Additionally, I set up the project in GitHub, and included some dependencies for measuring test coverage, style, and documentation with Maven. This repository is also linked to Labtool, and other project setup tasks should all be done.

## How it shows
GitHun repo is now alive, and has the required specifications document available. Most of the visible stuff is in the document itself.

## This week I learned
Tonnes about procedural generation, although I merely scraped the surface! I hope the interest carries on during the project, and beyond it. Already I also feel the lessons learned at TIRA will now really come to fruition. 

## Troubles I've seen
It seemed the map creation algorithms weren't a huge subject for academical study, some of the sources were not quite up on the level I had hoped for. Searching for sources with adequate information took some time, and then analysing whether the information was relevant took quite a while. Also, figuring out what exactly will be needed proved to be a more labourous task than I had imagined.

## Going forward
I hope to get a good start early next week, and get down to business. Only then will I really get the big picture and be able to evaluate whether the project is adequate, yet doable.
