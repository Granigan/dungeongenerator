## Final Week (7)

### What I got done
After last week's trouble with replacing the hashmap structure, I attacked it straight on, and was able to push past the hump. I was able to finish most of my goals, though of course the final result is not perfect. In addition to completing the homemade data structures, the last week included preparation for the demo, creating the systems check crawler and writing a bunch of docs and tests for the final build.

### How it shows
There's a [jar file](https://github.com/Granigan/dungeongenerator/blob/master/dungeongenerator.jar)!

Unfortunately, there are no command line parameters, so to test the app with different settings requires running it via e.g. NetBeans.

### This week I learned
More about data structures, there's no need to fear them, they can be created. The importance of systems check. Creating it last minute discovered a frequent, game-breaking bug I no longer had time to address.

### Troubles I've seen
Finishing the project while simultaneously starting a new period was quite a clash on the schedule. However, I'm happy with the final sprint, and feel the project was a success. 

### Going forward
Lots of other courses rolling in, so no immediate plans on carrying on with this project. However, in addition to learning a lot more about data structures and their nature, as well as getting to utilise algorithms for a genuine purpose was extremely satisfying. Procedural generation is also an interest that grew with this project.
